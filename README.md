# Learning about Apache Kafka
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform. 

## What
This repository contains examples of Apache Kafka code. 

## Why
1. Apache Kafka is very popular distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. I want to understand what that means, how it works, and why it is popular.
2. I want to learn more about Big Data systems, and I figured learning some Kafka could be a good starting point down that path.
